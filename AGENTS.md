# AGENTS.md — rules for AI agents in the repository

## Main
Before ANY code changes, the agent must read the code style rules and follow them.
Code style = contract. If instructions conflict, the code style wins.

✅ Code Style Rules: [CodeStyle.md](./CodeStyle.md)

---

## ⚠️ Tool restrictions
- **PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`)**: Allowed **ONLY** with explicit user permission.
- Otherwise, use Bash or built-in tools.

---

## 🚫 Forbidden actions
- **Creating or modifying Unity assets**: The agent must NOT create new assets or modify existing assets, including scenes (`.unity`), prefabs (`.prefab`), ScriptableObject assets (`.asset`), materials, textures, models, animations, and other Unity assets or their `.meta` files. This applies to direct file edits and changes made through Unity, scripts, generators, or other tools.
- **Git commits**: The agent does NOT make commits. Only the user.
- **Running tests**: The agent does NOT run and does NOT plan to run tests without an explicit request.
- **Project build by default**: The agent must NOT run a full project build unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Null checks by default**: The agent must NOT add `null` checks unless `null` is an expected and valid state by the logic.

## Mandatory workflow for the agent
1) Read: [CodeStyle.md](./CodeStyle.md)
2) Work only within the task (do not do "helpful" refactors without a request).
3) Follow the project architecture and existing patterns.
4) After changes:
   - check for compilation errors without running a full project build
   - ignore `dotnet build` / `.csproj` errors caused by missing Unity-generated DLLs from `Temp/bin/Debug` if the user confirmed they are not relevant for this project environment
   - do not add extra files/entities
   - do not change public APIs unless necessary

## What to write in the response after completing a task
- Briefly: what was done
- List of changed files
- How to verify (steps/menu/scene/button), if applicable
